    "\n",
    "Users can derive more trust in the software from that fact that it has\n",

    "\n",
    "This is true especially if the process includes peer review, for example\n",
    "in the form of documented code reviews, or through more formal peer\n",
    "review, for example when the software is published in a software journal\n",
    "that includes review of the software as well as review of the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the publication process itself will also make the developers\n",
    "more conscious about the quality of their software, given that the whole\n",

    "process, if it exists, will provide a means by which the developers get\n",

    "# How to publish your software?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two main routes\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, there are two main routes for publishing your\n",
    "software:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A more traditional publication route in the academic sense, where\n",
    "    software is deposited in an archival repository in a similar fashion\n",
    "    to the way scholarly publication of preprints works:\n",
    "    Software is deposited on a platform such as\n",
    "    [*Zenodo*](https://zenodo.org/) together with the metadata required\n",
    "    to cite it: author information, name of the published software,\n",
    "    version identifier, publication date, and the location where the\n",
    "    software can be found.\n",
    "    These software publications are given a unique persistent\n",
    "    identifier, such as a [*Digital Object Identifier\n",
    "    (DOI)*](https://web.archive.org/web/20200926012320/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier),\n",
    "    which makes it possible to refer to the software publication in an\n",
    "    unambiguous way, similarly to how depositing a preprint on BioRxiv\n",
    "    gives a DOI that can be used to cite that preprint.\n",
    "    The paper [*\"Software Citation\n",
    "    Principles\"*](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86) by Arfon M.\n",
    "    Smith, Daniel S. Katz, Kyle E. Niemeyer and the FORCE11 Software\n",
    "    Citation Working Group provides a comprehensive overview of how this\n",
    "    publication route allows software to be regarded as a first class\n",
    "    citizen in research.\n",
    "2.  A more development-centric route is the archiving of development\n",
    "    versions of software source code.\n",
    "    [*Software Heritage*](https://www.softwareheritage.org/#) - a UNESCO\n",
    "    project aiming to build the universal software archive - collects\n",
    "    source code from open repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket\n",
    "    and others, and saves it in a distributed long-term archive. This is\n",
    "    similar to how the Internet Archive, archive.org, saves web content\n",
    "    in a way that you can refer to versions of web content that no\n",
    "    longer exist..\n",
    "    In addition to the automatic collection, you can also request that a\n",
    "    specific repository be archived.\n",
    "    This has the advantage that the archived software will remain\n",
    "    citable through Software Heritage, even if the original repository\n",
    "    is not.\n",
    "    Software Heritage does not provide DOIs for archived software.\n",
    "    Instead, it provides its own persistent identifiers, for whole\n",
    "    snapshots of a repository, but more importantly also for releases,\n",
    "    single commits, specific directories, and file contents, even down\n",
    "    to specific lines of code in a source code file.\n",
    "    This makes Software Heritage great for referencing software source\n",
    "    code more generally, but is not ideal for academic citation, as not\n",
    "    all citation-relevant metadata is standardly provided with every\n",
    "    software.\n",
    "    There are, however, ways to get around this issue, as we will show\n",
    "    later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Publishing your software together with correct and complete metadata on\n",
    "a platform that gives you a DOI for it, such as Zenodo, is perhaps the\n",
    "best choice right now if you want your software to become part of your\n",
    "scholarly record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if you don't care so much for this more traditional academic\n",
    "way of publishing, but would rather give people the option to identify\n",
    "and reference highly specific versions or parts of your software,\n",
    "depositing it in the Software Heritage archive is probably what you\n",
    "should do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other ways to publish your software\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there are also some other options for software publication\n",
    "that each have their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If you are not interested in academic credit, or cannot publish your\n",
    "    software with a DOI for whatever reason, putting it in public\n",
    "    version control is the most basic step to make your software\n",
    "    available.\n",
    "    You can, for example, push your code to an open repository on\n",
    "    GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or another public coding platform.\n",
    "    This doesn't strictly qualify as publication in the traditional\n",
    "    sense: there will be no metadata available to cite your software for\n",
    "    example, unless you put in some effort to provide it.\n",
    "    And users will need to figure out the exact version they want to use\n",
    "    by themselves.\n",
    "    Also, the software is not strictly preserved (you can remove it\n",
    "    later, or the platform you are using may not survive, e.g. as\n",
    "    happened with Google Code).\n",
    "    Nevertheless, putting your source code on one of these platforms is\n",
    "    a valuable first step.\n",
    "    And ideally, at some point automatic archiving as provided by\n",
    "    Software Heritage will mean that your software can be accessed even\n",
    "    if the public repository goes away.\n",
    "    Doing just this will, however, make it hard for someone who wants to\n",
    "    cite your software in a paper.\n",
    "2.  You could also describe your software in a traditional journal\n",
    "    paper, perhaps saying something about the concept behind the\n",
    "    software or its functionality.\n",
    "    The Software Sustainability Institute maintains [*a list of journals\n",
    "    that accept such\n",
    "    papers*](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software).\n",
    "    The issue with this approach is that this is not really software\n",
    "    publication at all, mainly because the software itself is not\n",
    "    published, and depending on the journal, may not be part of the\n",
    "    peer-review of the paper.\n",
    "    Also, when you finish the next version of the software, it may not be\n",
    "    feasible or even possible to write a new paper describing this\n",
    "    version, especially if you follow the good software engineering\n",
    "    practice of releasing early and often, or you have users who want to\n",
    "    use a version of the code between releases.\n",
    "    There may still be some corner cases for choosing this way to\n",
    "    \"publish\" your software, for example when your institution does not\n",
    "    allow public sharing of source code, as may be the case for\n",
    "    system-critical or safety-critical software.\n",
    "3.  There is actually a very good compromise available between the more\n",
    "    traditional publication of a paper, and the publication of the\n",
    "    software and its versions by itself: software journals.\n",
    "    Software journals have developed over the last few years, and focus\n",
    "    on the publication of research software.\n",
    "    Publications in software journals combine a smaller amount of text\n",
    "    describing the software with software metadata, references to cited\n",
    "    works, and all the other ingredients for a journal publication.\n",
    "    They include links to the software source code, and most\n",
    "    importantly, they provide (ideally open) peer review for both the\n",
    "    software and the accompanying text.\n",
    "    The peer review of the software focuses on the quality of the\n",
    "    software, and the implementation of best practices, such as\n",
    "    comprehensive documentation and tests, reproducible environments,\n",
    "    etc., and also on the domain aspects of the software.\n",
    "    The most commonly used journal of this kind is the [*Journal of Open\n",
    "    Source Software (JOSS)*](https://joss.theoj.org/).\n",
    "    However, while publication in a software journal provides you with a\n",
    "    DOI for the software, and adds important quality checks through peer\n",
    "    review, it is not software publication as such.\n",
    "    This means, for example, that only a specific version of the\n",
    "    software is published and reviewed, but the following versions are\n",
    "    not, although they may be discoverable through links to the source\n",
    "    code repository.\n",
    "4.  Another option for publishing research software is the submission to\n",
    "    an index.\n",
    "    There are software indices available for software developed at a\n",
    "    specific institution, or group of institutions, or for\n",
    "    discipline-specific software.\n",
    "    [*swMath*](http://swmath.org/), for example, is an index for\n",
    "    mathematical software, [*bio.tools*](https://bio.tools/) for\n",
    "    bioinformatics software,\n",
    "    [*SciCrunch*](https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/) for\n",
    "    software from the life sciences, and the [*Astrophysics Source Code\n",
    "    Library (ASCL)*](http://ascl.net/) focuses on software developed for\n",
    "    astrophysics research.\n",
    "    These indices also provide persistent identifiers for their\n",
    "    entries.\n",
    "    DIfferent journals may or may not accept these\n",
    "    identifiers/citations.One particular advantage of adding software to\n",
    "    such an index is that they allow the addition of software that has\n",
    "    not been developed by the people who add the software to the index.\n",
    "    This is useful if you want a reference to someone else's software,\n",
    "    but such a reference doesn't exist yet: you can add it to an index,\n",
    "    and use the provided identifier in your work.\n",
    "    If your institution or discipline does not have a software index,\n",
    "    you can also use the Software Heritage Archive to achieve something\n",
    "    similar: you can [*request the archiving of a source code\n",
    "    repository*](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/save/), and use\n",
    "    the respective Software Heritage identifier to reference the\n",
    "    software once it's archived.\n",

    "## How to publish your software according to the Software Citation Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back to the Software Citation Principles, and the more\n",
    "traditional DOI-based publication route it recommends, we will now\n",
    "explain how this works.\n",
    "The general idea is that you provide the source code of your software as\n",
    "well as its metadata to a long-term archival repository.\n",
    "The source code and metadata are archived in the repository, which\n",
    "returns a DOI that points to the software and includes the metadata.\n",
    "Usually, both are provided together on a landing page.\n",
    "There are some important aspects in this publication process that make\n",
    "it suitable for software publication and citation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The software metadata includes all relevant information that you\n",
    "    need to cite the software, such as its name, a complete and correct\n",
    "    list of its authors, version information, and its publication date.\n",
    "2.  The software source code can also include documentation and other\n",
    "    artifacts related to the software. This can make it easier to use,\n",
    "    for example when attempting to reproduce research results that have\n",
    "    been obtained using the software.\n",
    "3.  You can publish all release versions of the software in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To link between the different published versions of software, you can\n",
    "use a separate DOI, whose metadata can point to the DOIs for the\n",
    "different versions.\n",
    "In theory, this could be done manually, for example to link between\n",
    "versions published with different publishers, but there doesn't exist\n",
    "any tooling for this yet, other than via citation.\n",
    "Thankfully, some repository platforms such as\n",
    "[*Zenodo*](https://zenodo.org/) provide this \"parent\" DOI automatically\n",
    "for all versions that are published there.\n",
    "Generally speaking, this is the preferred way for publishing software,\n",
    "as it publishes the object itself, i.e., the actual software version,\n",
    "and not a text proxy.\n",
    "A remaining challenge for this approach to software publication is,\n",
    "however, that it doesn't include the quality checks provided by peer\n",
    "review.\n",
    "These checks must still be carried out outside of the publication\n",
    "process, for example in the form of code reviews of new source code\n",
    "added to the source code repository, or as post-publication audits.\n",
    "Additionally, only the archived releases of the software can be cited."

    "2.  They want to refer to a specific version of the software, because\n",

    "Heritage link with the \\\"origin\\\" information provided.) For a specific\n",

    "Heritage link with the \\\"origin\\\" information provided), as well as\n",

    "captured from commits (as discussed in the previous section), this\n",
    "information must be determined and recorded by the authors themselves.\n",

    "re-written (of course, where the old author should still be listed as an\n",

    "## Where to store the metadata?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that much of it (except the authors) is stored with the code, and\n",
    "that someone who has the history of the code can find the other metadata\n",
    "associated with past versions, we believe that the author metadata also\n",

    "the process of updating the code. And since this has to be manually\n",
    "determined and updated, we might as well do the same for as much of the\n",
    "metadata possible. We can do this by storing the metadata in the\n",
    "software repository, which also means that it will be archived by\n",
    "Software Heritage, and changing our practice so that when we make a\n",
    "change to the code, and making matching changes to the tests and\n",
    "documents, we also make a matching change to the metadata, when needed.\n",
    "Much like the software documentation, a change to the code is unlikely\n",
    "to require that all the metadata be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The difference between publishing a paper and publishing software\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a place where the difference between open source software and\n",
    "published papers becomes clear. For a paper, there is generally one\n",
    "point at which the metadata needs to be recorded: when it is submitted\n",
    "to a publisher or a repository (though there can, of course, be multiple\n",
    "versions of a paper over time.) The paper is generally not available to\n",
    "be read or cited until this submission (and possibly peer-review)\n",

    "Zenodo) or a publisher (e.g., JOSS) when a major version is released.\n",
